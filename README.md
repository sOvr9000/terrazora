# Terrazora

Set in underground caverns of some planet, Terrazora is a single- or multiplayer 3D factory automation game inspired by several popular games in the genre.  It aims to provide a smooth, inuitive gameplay experience with challenges focused on spatial constraints, terraforming, power and lighting management, production chains, and the dangers of disturbing undiscovered life while drilling deeper to acquire more valuable resources.

A fresh start in the game poses immediate challenges due the absence of light.  Illuminating and building in the tunnels emits vibrational impact (VI), which triggers alien attacks from the darkness.  The gameplay is centered around balancing the tradeoff between production and the safety of the infrastructure, encouraging strategic development throughout the game.

Overall, Terrazora is intended to be a fresh take on the automation genre, appealing to players of the building, open world, simulation, and management genres, with a small touch of horror.
